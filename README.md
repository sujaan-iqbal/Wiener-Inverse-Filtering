# **Image Denoising and Deblurring using Wiener and Inverse Filters**  

## 🚀 **Overview**  
This project focuses on **restoring noisy and blurred images** using **Wiener and Inverse Filters**. It applies image processing techniques to enhance clarity by reducing noise and recovering lost details.  

## 🛠️ **Features**  
- **Noise Reduction:** Uses the Wiener filter to remove Gaussian noise.  
- **Deblurring:** Applies the Inverse filter to restore blurred images.  
- **Customizable Parameters:** Adjust filter settings for optimal results.  
- **Comparison Metrics:** Evaluate image quality before and after processing.  

## 📂 **Repository Contents**  
- `denoise_deblur.py` – Python script for applying Wiener and Inverse filters.  
- `sample_images/` – Sample noisy and blurred images for testing.  
- `results/` – Processed images after applying filters.  
- `README.md` – Project documentation.  

## 📊 **Algorithms Used**  
- **Wiener Filter:** Reduces noise while preserving image details.  
- **Inverse Filter:** Restores blurred images by reversing degradation effects.
